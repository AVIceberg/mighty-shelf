# Tokimon Database App Additional Features

The only additional feature added was the ability to 'free' the tokimons associated with a particular trainer. It can be found on the trainer's page as a button to be pressed; doing so will delete all tokimons owned by said trainer without deleting the trainer and update their level accordingly (to 1).

Additional features WERE planned, but this particular feature turned out to be unnecessarily complicated to figure out, and ate up far too much time.
